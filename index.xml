      <description>Welcome!  My name is Harshavardhan (Harsha) - I go to Duke, where I study math and computer science. Among many things, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the future of healthcare and in understanding how people think (and how to optimize the decisions that we make).
 One of my dreams is to build a platform for people like you and me, that can democratize inaccessible and uninterpretable tools to complement our everyday decision-making.</description>

      <description>Data Science Internship  I was a data science intern at Redhorse Corporation , a small government contractor/consulting firm headquarted in San Diego. I worked in a team to build a web application (using React and Flask), that could create a &amp;ldquo;subject matter expert&amp;rdquo; on any topic related to government processes. We built a containerized app using Docker and AWS that scraped data off of the Department of Defense website and applied various natural language processing algorithms like coreference resolution, named entity recognition, etc.</description>
